# Who We Are
If youâ€™re seeing this page and/or site, firstly, hello!ðŸ‘‹

Weâ€™re a team of dedicated and independent Security Researchers, Malware Analysts, and CTF Players. As a community founded team, we all deeply share the motivation of many others to make the digital seas just a little more safer for those that remain unsure of the risks associated with a digital presence.

# Our M.O.
Our primary goal when undergoing various threat investigations is to ensure that all the main primary indicators and intelligence information is collected and distributed with various vendors and teams, allowing for previously undetected threats to be identified and deterred before they hit their next target.

While no guarantee can be made about the success of every individual engagement, we take pride in our thorough process â€“whether it is IOC collection or providing in-depth system analysis. Our priority before any handovers can be made with collaborative entities, or publicly reporting on our investigations, is to ensure all parties have valid, reliable, and actionable resources to mitigate the chance a Threat Actor has at remaining hidden.
